                          at thorpe park, there is lots of things you can do, from going on rides to eating food to playing on arcade machines. I went on a few rides, like the flying fish ride, which was fun especially since it was fist ever rollercoster not just at thorpe park but at any theme park/funfare, evethough it was fun I was scared as I didn't know what to expect. I also went on the rumbd rapids, which was also fun and also went inside the black mirror labyrinth maze attraction, which was so cool especially the bits where its uses a picture of your face

                                I would recommend thorpe park to anyone who is looking for a fun day out, and if you are looking for a fun day out with your friends or family, then thorpe park is the place to go, you will have all the fun you could ever want either going on the rides or playing on the arcade machines and weither you are going on your own, with your friends or family.
