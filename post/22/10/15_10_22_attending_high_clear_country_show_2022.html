                              after 2 years when all events were cancelled due to covid and 4 year since we attended the last one, we finally got to go to the Highclear country show in Newbury in may of this year. must I say it isn't cheap especially as I dont drive or live in newbury so not just the entry we needed to pay for but also train tickets to and from andover train station and taxi fairs to and from newbury train station, however it was worth it.

                           during the event they have lots of activities going on, such as a dog show, horse show and more. they also have lots of stalls selling things such as food, clothes and other items like paintings, keyrings etc, also have a stage with lots of different country acts performing. they also have old oil engines on display, and if you want you can win yourself a shotgun or even let an 8 year old hold and learn how to use a shotgun.

                                the event grounds is not too far from the high clear castle itself so if you wanted to you can go and visit the castle, while visiting the country show. Fun fact downtown abby is filmed at the high clear castle in newbury.
                            </p>

                            if you have been playing to go to the high clear country show in newbury, I would highly recommend it. it is a great day out for all the family, and if you are a country fan like me, you will love it.
