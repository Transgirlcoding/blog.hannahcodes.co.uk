                               back in may 2022, the brand new central part of the Elizabeth line (paddington to abby wood) finally open to the public so I decided with some friends of mine to go and ride it on the very first day of opening.

                           what can i say it was definitely worth the 1 hour and 30+ minute journey to get there, the stations look amazing and the trains are very nice and modern especially compared to the underground trains. What I also loved was all staions had a different design and colour scheme and that they are fully accessible for disabled people. back when I travelled on the line, bond street was still under construction but it was nice that you could still see the progress that was being made.
                            </p>  
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                                We are only a few weeks away from the second phase of the Elizabeth line opening and in operation and I can't wait to go and ride it again. this will be the first time we will be able to ride the line all the way from reading to abbey wood without having to change at paddington main station to then head down to the paddington Elizabeth line patform to ride further on the line to stations like abby wood, also bond street will finally be open to the public and will be fully operational.
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog_post_p">
                             the second phase also includes more frequent services at peak time, which includes 22 trans an hour between paddington and abbey wood, an huge increase from the 12 trains an hour that is currently in operation, plus there will be more trains running later in the evening and on weekends and Elizabeth line will also be running a brand new sunday service which mean anyone planning to go to the any Elizabeth line station on a sunday will now be able to do so, which should help ease the pressure on the other tube lines like the central line and the northern line.
                          </p>
                          <p class="blog_post_p">
                            even with the second phase almost in operation, there is still a lot of work to be done on the line, the third and final phase of the Elizabeth line is still in the planning stages and will see the line extended to the west of london to stations like heathrow airport, reading and slough, this will be the biggest phase of the Elizabeth line and will see the line extended by 42 miles and will see the line extended to 73 miles in total which is expected to be completed by may 2023 when the final timetable/ phase will be up and running and the line will be fully operational to the general public.
