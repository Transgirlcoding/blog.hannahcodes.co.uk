                              I was so excited to go to this event, i had been looking forward to it for months, i was so excited to see all the amazing people that attend this event, the guest house I stayed at (Linden Guest House) was lovely, clean and only 2 minutes from southampton central train station and the lady who run the guest house was so friendly and helpful, i would definitely recommend this guest house to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Southampton, the only issues I had was both front keys I were given wouldn't work, which isn't great but She said she would get it looked at.

                                this year I hang out with a group of cool people, who offered for me to be with their group as I was on my own for the pride parade which happend a bit differently compaired to last year, It started at the same spot queens park and went through the highstreet, but instead of stoping before the entrance we took the giant pride flag into the venue, which was so unexspected but so cool, however the one thing I didnt like was after parade where we all to the giant flag to the park near by to get it folded away we had to then queue again to get back into the venue, which was a bit of a pain but it was worth it to be able to hold the giant pride flag in the venue with all the other cool people.
