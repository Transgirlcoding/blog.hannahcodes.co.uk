                               this year we saw the cinema release of the 3rd movie to the fantastic beast franchise 'The Secrets Of Dumbledore', so we decided we would go and see it as we've seen all the others and all of the Harry Potter films.

                            well I can say after watching It was amazing to watch, I do feel it was wrong of Warner brothers to let go of Johnny Depp over the accusations which were later found out to not be true, and i know eventhough JK rollowing wrote the script/book, i will still watch the films as for one I dont really care what she has said or done and two and really like watching Fantastic Beast and Harry Potter.

                                 I am hoping when the last fantastic beast film gets released they should link it with Harry Potter like we see younger versions of harry's dead parents before they are murdered by the one who should not be named (Lord Volfemort) since the fantastic beast film are supposed to be set before the Harry potter films/era
